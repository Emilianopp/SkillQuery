A personal passion project that started when I was begining recruiting. 

I found comapnies asked for an overwhelming amount of technologies. So I decided to comile that information into a single interface to help other students decide what to invest their time into. 

Backend is built on Flask,MongoDB as well as a fine tuned BERT model that was tweaked for classification of job descriptions. 

Access to backend repository please take a look at [https://github.com/Emilianopp/skillQuery-backend](https://github.com/Emilianopp/skillQuery-backend)
